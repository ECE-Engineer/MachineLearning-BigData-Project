# MachineLearning-BigData-Project
This project is about providing a GUI that interfaces with a custom implementation of a HashTable Algorithm, different similarity metrics used in big data analytics and machine learning, and very large data sets from the Kepler Object API. The GUI will allow the user to display all the Kepler Objects of Interest, display only Kepler Objects of Interest with selected features, or finding the most similar Kepler Object of Interest to the one selected. An additional feature was also added to find the 2 most similar Kepler Objects of Interest in the entire data set if needed.
