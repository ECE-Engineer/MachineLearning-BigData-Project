# MachineLearning-BigData-Project
The first part of this project is about providing a GUI that interfaces with a custom implementation of a HashTable Algorithm, different similarity metrics used in big data analytics and machine learning, and very large data sets from the Kepler Object API. The GUI will allow the user to display all the Kepler Objects of Interest, display only Kepler Objects of Interest with selected features, or finding the most similar Kepler Object of Interest to the one selected. An additional feature was also added to find the 2 most similar Kepler Objects of Interest in the entire data set if needed.

The second part of this project is about implementing a custom persistent BTree structure, interfacing it with the current state of the program and utilize k-means-clustering and z-score normalization to display the clustering of the data to the user. The user may then select the number of clusters they want to make and which ones they want to see.
